### Nicole's Notes

#### Did You Know? GPT-4.1 Brings More Accurate Code Completions

The new GPT-4.1 Copilot model represents a significant improvement in code completion accuracy. This model has been specifically refined using reinforcement learning based on real user feedback, meaning it learns from how developers actually use and accept suggestions.

What makes this particularly valuable is the extended knowledge cutoff and additional high-quality training data. This means better understanding of newer frameworks, libraries, and coding patterns that weren't available in previous model versions.

You'll automatically see this model in your code completion model picker â€“ no action required on your part. The improvements are most noticeable in complex code scenarios, API usage patterns, and when working with modern development frameworks.
