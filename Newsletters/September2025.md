### Nicole's Notes

#### Did You Know? Copilot Workspace Can Simulate Entire Application Environments

With the general availability of GitHub Copilot Workspace, you can now create and test complete application environments without leaving GitHub. This is particularly powerful for government agencies that need to validate applications across different deployment scenarios while maintaining security isolation.

Copilot Workspace can simulate production-like environments, run comprehensive test suites, and even perform security assessments, all within a controlled, compliant cloud environment. This capability significantly reduces the time between development and deployment while ensuring that security and compliance requirements are met throughout the development lifecycle.
