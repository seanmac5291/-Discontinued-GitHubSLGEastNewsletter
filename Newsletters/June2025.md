# Nicole's Notes

### Did You Know?
With the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the ability to build custom integrations, securely connecting your enterprise data and tools to AI agents like Claude is a key consideration. You can build secure, production-ready MCP servers protected by Microsoft Entra ID using Azure API Management. This approach allows you to leverage the power of AI agents interacting with your sensitive data while maintaining strong security boundaries and access controls. It's a great example of how you can adopt agentic AI capabilities responsibly within a regulated environment.
