### Copilot Updates

This month's updates focus on expanding access to powerful new features and providing administrators with better control and visibility.

#### Latest Releases
* **Copilot Coding Agent for Business Users (`PREVIEW`)** â€“ Previously limited to Enterprise plans, the powerful Copilot coding agent is now in preview for Copilot Business users. You can now assign issues to Copilot to autonomously work on a solution, create a branch, and open a pull request for review, all within its own secure cloud environment. - [[Read the Announcement]](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-24-github-copilot-coding-agent-is-now-available-for-copilot-business-users/)
* **Premium Model Billing Now in Effect (`GA`)** â€“ As of June, the monthly premium request allowances for Copilot plans are now enforced. This provides predictability for your standard usage, which remains unlimited for core chat and completions, while giving you pay-as-you-go control over usage of more advanced models. You can monitor usage and set spending limits in your billing settings. - [[View the Billing Update]](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-18-update-to-github-copilot-consumptive-billing-experience/)

### Security & Platform Updates

Key updates this month focus on giving you more granular control over your security policies and improving on-premises performance and governance.

* **Customizable Push Protection Patterns (`PREVIEW`)** - Security teams can now choose exactly which secret scanning patterns are included in push protection. This gives your agency the power to block a much wider and more specific set of secrets relevant to your internal tools, preventing them from ever being committed to your repositories. - [[Read the Announcement]](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-25-configuring-which-secret-scanning-patterns-are-included-in-push-protection-is-in-public-preview/)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.17 (`GA`)** â€“ The latest on-premises release is now available. GHES 3.17 brings System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) into general availability for easier user lifecycle management. It also enhances code security with new standalone product offerings (Secret Protection & Code Security), and allows GitHub Apps to be owned at the enterprise level for simpler administration. - [[See the Release Notes]](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.17/admin/release-notes)
* **Standalone Security for Azure DevOps (`GA`)** â€“ For agencies using Azure DevOps, you can now purchase **GitHub Secret Protection** and **GitHub Code Security** as standalone products. This brings GitHub's best-in-class security features, including CodeQL scanning and secret scanning push protection, directly to your Azure DevOps repositories. - [[Learn More]](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/github-secret-protection-and-github-code-security-for-azure-devops/)

### Nicole's Notes

#### Did You Know? You Can Secure Your Supply Chain Directly in Your Pull Request.

A common challenge for government agencies is ensuring that every new piece of code doesn't introduce a vulnerable open source dependency. Manually checking licenses and vulnerabilities for every change is impossible at scale.

This is where the **Dependency Review Action** comes in. You can configure this GitHub Action to run automatically on every pull request. It scans for dependencies being changed, added, or removed and checks them against your defined policies. It will flag any packages with known vulnerabilities or non-compliant licenses (like copyleft licenses) *before* they are merged into your main branch. Itâ€™s a powerful, automated control that hardens your software supply chain, a key requirement for secure development.
