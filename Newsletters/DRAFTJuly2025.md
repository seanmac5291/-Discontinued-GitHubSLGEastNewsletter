### Nicole's Notes

#### Did You Know? You Can Add Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

You can guide GitHub Copilotâ€™s behavior in Copilot Chat by adding a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to your repository. This allows you to tailor suggestions to your projectâ€™s conventions without manually specifying context every time. Make Copilot Instructions part of a repository template when creating new repositories so that you can share best practices across your Organization!

### The GovTech Grapevine

* [PDFs are the tip of the spear for Code for America's new AI studio](https://statescoop.com/code-for-america-ai-pdf-accessibility-2025/) (StateScoop) â€“ With new federal accessibility rules looming, government agencies are turning to AI to tackle the massive and tedious job of making thousands of PDF documents accessible to people with disabilities. Code for America has developed a new tool that uses a machine learning algorithm to automatically classify and help remediate these files, turning a manual chore into a manageable tech problem.
* [Senate kills off proposed moratorium on state AI law enforcement](https://statescoop.com/state-ai-moratorium-dies-senate/) (StateScoop) â€“ In a nearly unanimous 99-1 vote, the U.S. Senate removed a controversial provision from a budget bill that would have blocked states from creating or enforcing their own AI-related laws for ten years. The move is being hailed as a major victory for state and local governments, preserving their authority to regulate AI and protect citizens from potential harms.
* [Budget and cyber pressures impede tech upgrades by state and local governments, finds EY survey](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/06/budget-and-cyber-pressures-impede-tech-upgrades-by-state-and-local-governments-finds-ey-survey) (EY / StateScoop) â€“ According to a new EY survey of 300 state and local IT leaders, the top priorities for this fiscal year are reducing costs (56%) and improving cybersecurity (54%). Modernizing legacy systems, while a long-term goal, is taking a backseat to these more immediate pressures, even as AI adoption has roughly tripled in the past five years.

If you have any questions or want to discuss these updates in detail, feel free to reach out. As always, Iâ€™m here to help you and your team stay informed and get the most value from GitHub.
