### Copilot Updates

This month's updates focus on expanding access to powerful new features and providing administrators with better control and visibility.

#### Latest Releases
* **Copilot Coding Agent for Business Users (`PREVIEW`)** â€“ Previously limited to Enterprise plans, the powerful Copilot coding agent is now in preview for Copilot Business users. You can now assign issues to Copilot to autonomously work on a solution, create a branch, and open a pull request for review, all within its own secure cloud environment. - [[Read the Announcement]](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-24-github-copilot-coding-agent-is-now-available-for-copilot-business-users/)
* **Premium Model Billing Now in Effect (`GA`)** â€“ As of June, the monthly premium request allowances for Copilot plans are now enforced. This provides predictability for your standard usage, which remains unlimited for core chat and completions, while giving you pay-as-you-go control over usage of more advanced models. You can monitor usage and set spending limits in your billing settings. - [[View the Billing Update]](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-18-update-to-github-copilot-consumptive-billing-experience/)
* **Larger Context in Copilot Chat (`PREVIEW`)** â€“ Copilot Chat can now understand more of your conversation and accept larger pasted snippets of code and text.

### Security & Platform Updates

Key updates this month focus on giving you more granular control over your security policies and improving on-premises performance and governance.

* **Customizable Push Protection Patterns (`PREVIEW`)** - Security teams can now choose exactly which secret scanning patterns are included in push protection. This gives your agency the power to block a much wider and more specific set of secrets relevant to your internal tools, preventing them from ever being committed to your repositories. - [[Read the Announcement]](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-25-configuring-which-secret-scanning-patterns-are-included-in-push-protection-is-in-public-preview/)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.17 (`GA`)** â€“ The latest on-premises release is now available. GHES 3.17 brings System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) into general availability for easier user lifecycle management. It also enhances code security with new standalone product offerings (Secret Protection & Code Security), and allows GitHub Apps to be owned at the enterprise level for simpler administration. - [[See the Release Notes]](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.17/admin/release-notes)
* **Standalone Security for Azure DevOps (`GA`)** â€“ For agencies using Azure DevOps, you can now purchase **GitHub Secret Protection** and **GitHub Code Security** as standalone products. This brings GitHub's best-in-class security features, including CodeQL scanning and secret scanning push protection, directly to your Azure DevOps repositories. - [[Learn More]](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/github-secret-protection-and-github-code-security-for-azure-devops/)

### Nicole's Notes

#### Did You Know? You Can Add Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

You can guide GitHub Copilotâ€™s behavior in Copilot Chat by adding a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to your repository. This allows you to tailor suggestions to your projectâ€™s conventions without manually specifying context every time. Make Copilot Instructions part of a repository template when creating new repositories so that you can share best practices across your Organization!

### The GovTech Grapevine

* [PDFs are the tip of the spear for Code for America's new AI studio](https://statescoop.com/code-for-america-ai-pdf-accessibility-2025/) (StateScoop) â€“ With new federal accessibility rules looming, government agencies are turning to AI to tackle the massive and tedious job of making thousands of PDF documents accessible to people with disabilities. Code for America has developed a new tool that uses a machine learning algorithm to automatically classify and help remediate these files, turning a manual chore into a manageable tech problem.
* [Senate kills off proposed moratorium on state AI law enforcement](https://statescoop.com/state-ai-moratorium-dies-senate/) (StateScoop) â€“ In a nearly unanimous 99-1 vote, the U.S. Senate removed a controversial provision from a budget bill that would have blocked states from creating or enforcing their own AI-related laws for ten years. The move is being hailed as a major victory for state and local governments, preserving their authority to regulate AI and protect citizens from potential harms.
* [Budget and cyber pressures impede tech upgrades by state and local governments, finds EY survey](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2025/06/budget-and-cyber-pressures-impede-tech-upgrades-by-state-and-local-governments-finds-ey-survey) (EY / StateScoop) â€“ According to a new EY survey of 300 state and local IT leaders, the top priorities for this fiscal year are reducing costs (56%) and improving cybersecurity (54%). Modernizing legacy systems, while a long-term goal, is taking a backseat to these more immediate pressures, even as AI adoption has roughly tripled in the past five years.
