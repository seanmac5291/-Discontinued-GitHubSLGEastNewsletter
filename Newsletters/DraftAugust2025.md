### Nicole's Notes

#### Did You Know? You Can Set Custom Base Branches for Copilot Coding Agent Tasks

When using the GitHub Copilot coding agent to implement features or fix issues, you can now specify which branch the agent should use as its starting point. This is particularly valuable for organizations with complex branching strategies or when you want the agent to work from a specific release branch rather than main.

This capability, combined with custom instructions support, gives your team unprecedented control over how AI assistance integrates with your established development workflows and governance practices.
